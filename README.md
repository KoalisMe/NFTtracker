# NFTtracker
NFT tracker iOS app

As an iOS Developer and NFT enthusiast - I would like to create a POC(Proof of concept) of mobile iOS application

The problem:
- because a lot of bots make offers every second iteratively - it's hard to see offers from real people.
- some valuable assets are sold to bots for a price below a floor price (using WETH) and then are put up for sale by floor price. 

Features:
- retrieving information about assets of my favorite collections.
- retrieving information with last offers and events to track specific assets.
- retrieving information about assets and filter without purchase history (to track holders).
- quick access via link to the specific asset.
